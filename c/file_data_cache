/*
 * Simple block cache optimized for systems from 1 to 8 GB RAM.
 * Pathname lookup for already-open files is a hash lookup. File
 * numbers are 1 + an index into tables allocated at startup time
 * based on the maximum number of open files that need to be
 * handled (default is 250).
 *
 * Once the entry is found, either by pathname lookup or by the
 * index into the table used in subsequent file operations,
 * inside the smb_node struct is a set of indices into the
 * extents of 64 KB-allocated pages used by this file.
